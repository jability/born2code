# born2code spacemacs

My Spacemacs configuration.

This includes the `born2code` layer (for efficient work at 42 school)
and my personal `init.el` dotfile.

## Installation
First, install spacemacs as usual. See [here](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs).

To install this set of custom files, clone this whole repository into your `.emacs.d/private`
directory. Then add this symlink :

    ln -s ~/.emacs.d/private/init.el ~/.spacemacs
